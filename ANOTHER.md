## First we add some text
###This is a tertiary heading, the previous one is a secondary heading.
When you open this file on github, the text will be presented in a nice and ordered way because this text is formatted in markdown language.
* First Element
* Second Element
* Third Element

Like you may see, Git and Markdown are extremely easy, you should practice the git bash commands because you may find this very useful and many of its commands are self explanatory.

Have a happy coding!
